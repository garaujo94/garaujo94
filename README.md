### About me
I'm a data scientist Addicted to optimization and productivity, I've always wanted to improve the way things are done. Self-taught most of the time, I am always learning something new and deepening the knowledge I already have.

I currently have a Technical MBA focused on Machine Learning, Big Data, Smart Methods and mathematical and statistical decision support methods at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, and I am a master's student in electrical engineering at Federal Center of Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro.

I currently work at a lawtech using statistics, Machine Learning and Monte Carlo simulation to predict conviction rates in lawsuits, project portfolio values â€‹â€‹and more.
